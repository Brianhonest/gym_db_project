1NF
All tables have atomic attributes, primary keys, and no repeating groups.
Therefore, the schema is in 1NF.

2NF
The schema satisfies Second Normal Form. While most tables use surrogate primary keys, ClassRegistration has a natural composite candidate key of
(member_id, class_id),no  attribute depends only on member_id and no attribute depends only on class_id
3NF
All tables are in Third Normal Form with no transitive dependencies. A potential concern was the relationship between room_number and floor, however
room numbers are arbitary labels,so afunctional dependencies doesnt exist.
